NOTES:
The NFS Provisioner service has now been installed.

A storage class named 'nfs' has now been created
and is available to provision dynamic volumes.

You can use this storageclass by creating a `PersistentVolumeClaim` with the
correct storageClassName attribute. For example:

    ---
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: test-dynamic-volume-claim
    spec:
      storageClassName: "nfs"
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 100Mi
